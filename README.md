# portfolio HTML CSS Figma and Bootstrap
Website I designed in Figma and coded using bootstrap for my HTML/CSS basics course in Laurea, also works as my portfolio

I'm still changing and fixing my portfolio, since it was made in a short time span and I like to improve and update it as I get better.
